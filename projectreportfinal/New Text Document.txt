where name can be used to optionally identify the critical region. Identifiers naming a critical region have external linkage.
Note:

The compiler reports an error if you try to branch into or out of a critical section. Some situations that will cause an error are:

    A critical section that contains the return statement.
    A critical section that contains goto, continue, or break statements that transfer program flow outside of the critical section.
    A goto statement outside a critical section that transfers program flow to a label defined within a critical section.
